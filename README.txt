# unidaysentry

Project: Unidays placement entry challenge
Author: Tanzy (Jingxin) Sun

How to run the code:
To run the code, the test file must be included as well, the test class demonstrates the different outcomes of the main class,
such as the different delivery types. 
The pricing is included within the test class as so:
  // pricing for items in itemList
		int pricing[] = { 8, 12, 4, 7, 5 };
	// no delivery charge
		UnidaysDiscountChallenge example1 = new UnidaysDiscountChallenge(pricing);
so pricing can be passed in to the UnidaysDiscountChallenge constructor, and changed when needed.
Also the itemList array (in main class) can be changed and are referenced as A through E,however discounts cannot be changed as interpreted.
After running, there will be 3 toString print outs to console to display total, delivery charges and overall total of the basket.


How I approached the problem:
As a start, i broke up the problem into small manageable sections on paper. I also calculated all the maths for the discount deals on 
paper first and had it thoroughly checked before i started coding. Once i had the sections all mapped out, i planned out the pseudocode

code tdd


 i went through the problem on paper first, planning out the pseudocode carefully before programming it.  
and testing it as i went along, therefore when an error occurred, it was much easier to detect and fix
the problem. 


it. Furthermore, commenting what each chunk of code does helped me to keep track of things and understand my code better, as well as 
making debugging easier.
